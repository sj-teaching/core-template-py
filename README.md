CORE Interpreter
================

This is a public folder for the CORE interpreter implemented in Python (2.7). It
provides a template for the Tokenizer and some test cases. You can use it to get
started on your implementation and also check the expected output for the given
test cases.

Directory structure:
- Tokenizer.py   Contains the python source
- data/          Contains test cases and expected results

Usage:

You can run it using `python Tokenizer.py inputFile.core` to produce the token stream as a series of integers.

You can also use the bash script `run.sh` to execute your Tokenizer on each of the valid test cases in the data/ folder, and compare the output against the expected results using a `diff` command.
